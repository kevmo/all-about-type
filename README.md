# All About Type
I can't contain my love for letters and type, so I made this repo to contain some of it for me.

## General Definitions
**Typeface**: The name for a family of type (e.g., Futura)

**Font**: A family member of a typeface (e.g., Futura Book)

**Lettering**: Type that is illustrated, design, or otherwise created without using fonts
